    "(1) `alert('hello');`: Display a message in a pop-up window\n",
    "(2) Math\n",
    "(3) `document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';`: Modify the webpage (see DOM for more details)\n",
    "(4) `typeof 'hello'`: Return data type of a value\n",
    "(5) `console.log('hello')`: Output a message to console\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Semicolon means the end of an instruction, we can write two instructions in the same line as long as we use semicolon between them! If we write one instruction per line, we can choose not to include semicolon because JavaScript automatically inserts semicolon at the end of the line! However, it is still a good practice to mannually insert semicolon at the end of an instruction!"

Thus the result of 0.1 + 0.2 is weird! \n",

This works when the money is in dollar and only has two decimal places, thus converting to cents make the money an integer! Since computers can store integers properly, there is no inaccuracy when calculating with integers!!!     \n",

Normally we use `document.body.innerHTML` to get or change all the html between `<body>` and `</body>` (exclusive), its type is String! It means that if we want to change the inner HTML between body tag, we should write the html code in quote! e.g. `document.body.innerHTML = '<button onclick=\"alert(\\'suprise!\\')\">clickMe</button>'`, note that we use `\\'` because we include single quote inside single quote!\n",

    "(1) `array.length`: the number of elements in an array\n",
    "(2) `array.push(value)`: push value to the end of the array\n",
    "(3) `array.splice(index, number)`: delete #number elements starting at `array[index]`!\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) `array.forEach(function(value, index, arr) {...})`: execute the provided function once on each array element!\n",
    "(5) `const newArray = array.filter(function(value, index, arr) { return condition })`: create a new array, execute the provided function on each array element and add elements that pass the test (i.e. elements that can make 'condition' true!) to new array!\n",
    "(6) `const newArray = array.map(function(value, index, arr) { return newValue })`: create a new array, execute the provided function on each array element and add the return value to new array! \n",

    "(1) For Loop: `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // array[i] }`\n",
    "(2) forEach: `array.forEach(function(value, index, array){...})`, execute a function on each item in an array, `value` is item value and `index` is item index! It is a preferred way to loop through an array! Note that we cannot use 'continue' and 'break' in forEach, instead, we can use 'return' which works the same as 'continue'! However, there is no good alternative of 'break', thus if we want to use 'break', then it's better to use for loop or while loop!\n",

    "5. Arrays are references! See Objects for more details!\n",
    "`const array2 = array1` is \"copy by reference\", both arrays point to the same location! `const array2 = array1.slice()` is \"copy by value\", both arrays point to different locations with the same value!\n",

    "Destructuring: `const [firstValue, secondValue, ...] = array`, this is the same as `const firstValue = array[0]; const secondValue = array[1]; ...`\n",
    "Note that Destructuring Assignment is a very important feature introduced in ES6, we can even use it to **swap values of two variables without a temporary variable**: `[a, b] = [b, a]`!!! "
