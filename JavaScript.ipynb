Since computers can store integers properly, there is no inaccuracy when calculating with integers!!!     \n",

    "(4) Remove the new CSS style: `.classList.remove('newClassName')`, the element returns to the old CSS style! Note that if we want to remove a class, we don't have to first check if this class exists and then remove it! Because 'remove' removes a class if it exists and does nothing if it doesn't exist!"

    "1. onclick: often used in `<button>`, what will happen when clicking the button\n",
    "2. onkeydown: often used in `<input>`, what will happen when typing in the input box, usually we write `onkeydown=\"if (event.key === 'Enter') { submit(); }\"` so that pressing Enter is the same as clicking the submit button! Note that `event` is an object provided by every event listener!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing inline JS code, we can always use `addEventListener(type, listener)`, e.g. \n",

    "document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', func) // listener can be either a function name or arrow/anonymous function!\n",

    "## Array\n",
    "Array is a sprcial type of Object, it represents list of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define an array: `const array = [item1, item2, item3];`, it is a common practice to define an array with 'const', we can still update it, but we cannot re-assign a value! Items can be of different data types!\n",
    "2. Access or change an array element: `array[index] = ...`, 'index' can be 0 to 'array.length - 1'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Array methods:\n",
    "(1) `array.length`: the number of elements in an array\n",
    "(2) `array.push(value)`: push value to the end of the array\n",
    "(3) `array.splice(index, number)`: delete #number elements starting at `array[index]`!\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) `array.forEach(function(value, index, arr) {...})`: execute the provided function once on each array element!\n",
    "(5) `const newArray = array.filter(function(value, index, arr) { return condition })`: create a new array, execute the provided function on each array element and add elements that pass the test (i.e. elements that can make 'condition' true!) to new array!\n",
    "(6) `const newArray = array.map(function(value, index, arr) { return newValue })`: create a new array, execute the provided function on each array element and add the return value to new array! \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `.push` and `.splice` modify the original array, `.forEach`, `.filter`, and `.map` don't modify the original array!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loop through an array\n",
    "(1) For Loop: `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // array[i] }`\n",
    "(2) forEach: `array.forEach(function(value, index, array){...})`, execute a function on each item in an array, `value` is item value and `index` is item index! It is a preferred way to loop through an array! Note that we cannot use 'continue' and 'break' in forEach, instead, we can use 'return' which works the same as 'continue'! However, there is no good alternative of 'break', thus if we want to use 'break', then it's better to use for loop or while loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Arrays are references! See Objects for more details!\n",
    "`const array2 = array1` is \"copy by reference\", both arrays point to the same location! `const array2 = array1.slice()` is \"copy by value\", both arrays point to different locations with the same value!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Shortcut\n",
    "Destructuring: `const [firstValue, secondValue, ...] = array`, this is the same as `const firstValue = array[0]; const secondValue = array[1]; ...`\n",
    "Note that Destructuring Assignment is a very important feature introduced in ES6, we can even use it to **swap values of two variables without a temporary variable**: `[a, b] = [b, a]`!!! "
